Our shooting system uses solenoid and capacitors to operate it.

Design:
We are controlling a relay by a transistor which is controlled by arduino, 
this relay is SPDT relay and it switches between two circuits. First one is to charge capacitors,
second is to discharge capacitors.

Tests and timeline:
We tried firstly 1cm stroke solenoid however it is not sufficent for us to satisfy a nice shoot.
Then we bought a bigger solenoid whose stroke is 3.3cm and we tried to operate it 
by a 2.2mF capacitor however it is not enough to give desired power.

Then we tested 10mF capacitors with different test setups such as by connecting parallel we set
our total capacitance as 10mF, 20mF and 30mF.

After test 20mF is a optimum choice by considering the charging time and power given to the 
solenoid.

Results:
1)Now, two 10mF capacitors are connected parallel making 20mF and by connecting 50ohm serial
to that circuit 4 seconds charging time could be achieved.
2)Arduino is okay with controlling transistor and it's okay with controlling 15A relay.
