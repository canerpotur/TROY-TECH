Amplifier is tried in the design lab. Results:
1) Power consumption should be considered, it takes 2A at 12V.
2)The range cannot be seen significantly improved however we think that it could be because of the structure of E building and whatever exists in the upstairs in power labs.(huge coils etc.)
3)For the real test we will try to operate it in the real ares where our robot will run.
